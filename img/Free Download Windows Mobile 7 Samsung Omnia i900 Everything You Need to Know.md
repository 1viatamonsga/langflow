## Step 1: Backup Your Data
 
Before you proceed with the installation of Windows Mobile 7 on your Samsung Omnia i900, you should backup your data such as contacts, messages, photos, videos, music, and other files. This is because the installation process will erase all the data on your phone and restore it to factory settings. You can use Samsung's PC Studio software or any other backup tool to transfer your data from your phone to your computer. You should also backup your phone's ROM image in case something goes wrong and you need to restore your original operating system.
 
## Step 2: Download Windows Mobile 7 ROM for Samsung Omnia i900
 
The next step is to download the Windows Mobile 7 ROM file for Samsung Omnia i900. A ROM file is a compressed package that contains the operating system and other software components that are required to run your phone. There are several websites that offer custom ROMs for various devices, but you should be careful and choose a reliable and trusted source. One of the most popular websites for downloading custom ROMs is XDA Developers Forum (https://forum.xda-developers.com/). Here you can find many threads and posts from developers and users who share their experiences and feedback on different ROMs. You can search for "Windows Mobile 7 Samsung Omnia i900" or similar keywords and find the ROM that suits your needs and preferences. Make sure to read the instructions and reviews carefully before downloading the ROM file.
 
## Step 3: Flash Windows Mobile 7 ROM on Samsung Omnia i900
 
The final step is to flash the Windows Mobile 7 ROM file on your Samsung Omnia i900. Flashing means copying the ROM file from your computer to your phone's memory and overwriting the existing operating system. To flash the ROM file, you will need a special software tool called Odin (https://odindownload.com/). Odin is a program that allows you to connect your phone to your computer via USB cable and flash various files such as ROMs, kernels, recovery images, etc. You will also need a USB driver for your phone that enables Odin to recognize it. You can download the USB driver from Samsung's website (https://www.samsung.com/us/support/downloads/) or use the one that comes with PC Studio.
