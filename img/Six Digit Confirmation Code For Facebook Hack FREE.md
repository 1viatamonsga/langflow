 <article>
<p>Facebook is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world, with over 2.8 billion monthly active users. However, this also makes it a target for hackers who want to access your personal information, photos, messages, and contacts. To prevent unauthorized access to your Facebook account, you should enable two-factor authentication (2FA), which requires you to enter a six digit confirmation code in addition to your password when you log in from a new device or location.</p>
<p>Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your Facebook account, as it makes it harder for hackers to break into your account even if they have your password. The six digit confirmation code is randomly generated and sent to your phone via SMS or an authentication app, such as Google Authenticator or Duo. You can also use a physical security key that plugs into your USB port or connects via NFC. You can choose which method you prefer in your Facebook settings.</p>

<p>To enable two-factor authentication on Facebook, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Facebook in your browser and click the arrow icon in the top right corner to expand the menu. Then go to Settings & Privacy > Settings > Security and Login.</li>
<li>Under Two-Factor Authentication, click Edit next to Use two-factor authentication.</li>
<li>You may have to enter your password to proceed. Then select the method you want to use for receiving the six digit confirmation code: Text Message (SMS), Authentication App, or Security Key.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions on the screen to set up your chosen method. For example, if you choose Text Message (SMS), you will have to enter your phone number and confirm it with a code that Facebook will send you.</li>
<li>Once you have set up your method, click Finish. You can also add backup methods, such as recovery codes or trusted contacts, in case you lose access to your primary method.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, whenever you log in to Facebook from a new device or location, you will have to enter the six digit confirmation code that Facebook will send you via SMS or an authentication app, or use your security key. This way, you can protect your Facebook account from hackers and keep your data safe.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Facebook provides some backup methods that can help you recover your account if you lose your six digit confirmation code. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recovery codes: These are 10 codes that you can generate and save when you set up two-factor authentication. Each code can be used once to log in without the six digit confirmation code. You should keep these codes in a safe place, such as a password manager or a paper notebook.</li>
<li>Trusted contacts: These are friends that you can choose to help you if you get locked out of your account. You will need to select at least three trusted contacts in your Facebook settings. If you lose your six digit confirmation code, you can ask your trusted contacts to send you a recovery code that you can use to log in.</li>
<li>Another device: If you have logged in to Facebook on another device before, such as your laptop or tablet, you may be able to use that device to access your account without the six digit confirmation code. You can also use that device to change your two-factor authentication settings or disable it temporarily.</li>
</ul>
<p>To use these backup methods, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the login screen, enter your email address or phone number and password as usual.</li>
<li>When Facebook asks you for the six digit confirmation code, click on Need another way to authenticate? at the bottom.</li>
<li>Select the backup method that you want to use: Recovery codes, Trusted contacts, or Another device.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions on the screen to use the backup method and log in to your account.</li>
<li>Once you have logged in, go to your Facebook settings and update or reset your two-factor authentication method.</li>
</ol>
<p>By using these backup methods, you can recover your Facebook account if you lose your six digit confirmation code. However, you should always keep your phone number and authentication app updated and secure, and store your security key and recovery codes in a safe place. This way, you can avoid getting locked out of your account and enjoy the benefits of two-factor authentication.</p>
