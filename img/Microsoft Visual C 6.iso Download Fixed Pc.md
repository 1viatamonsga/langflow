# How to Download and Install Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 on Your PC
 
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 is a powerful and popular development tool for creating Windows applications using C and C++ languages. It was released in 1998 and is still used by many legacy projects that require it. However, finding and installing Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 can be challenging, as it is no longer supported or available from Microsoft's official website. In this article, we will show you how to download and install Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 on your PC using an ISO file.
 
## What is an ISO file?
 
An ISO file is a disk image file that contains all the data of a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, including the file system and the boot information. An ISO file can be used to create a virtual drive on your PC, which can then be used to install software or run programs without needing a physical disc. You can also burn an ISO file to a blank disc using a CD/DVD writer software.
