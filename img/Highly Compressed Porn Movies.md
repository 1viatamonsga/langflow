MecSoft RhinoCAM is a powerful and versatile CAM software that can handle any type of machining project. Whether you are a hobbyist, a professional, or an educator, you can benefit from the features and functions of MecSoft RhinoCAM. You can create high-quality toolpaths, optimize your machining time and material usage, and produce accurate and reliable results. With MecSoft RhinoCAM, you can turn your designs into reality with ease and efficiency.

One of the main advantages of MecSoft RhinoCAM is its seamless integration with Rhinoceros 3D, one of the most popular and powerful 3D modeling software in the market. You can use Rhinoceros 3D to create and edit your 3D models, and then switch to MecSoft RhinoCAM to generate the toolpaths and G-code for your CNC machine. You can also import and export your models and toolpaths in various formats, such as IGES, STEP, STL, DXF, DWG, and more. MecSoft RhinoCAM allows you to work with both surface and solid models, and supports NURBS curves and meshes.
  
MecSoft RhinoCAM also provides a comprehensive simulation feature that lets you preview and verify your toolpaths before sending them to your CNC machine. You can simulate the entire machining process, including the stock material, the cutting tools, the spindle speed, the feed rate, and the toolpath motion. You can also view the simulation from different angles and perspectives, and zoom in and out to inspect the details. The simulation feature helps you to avoid errors, collisions, and waste of material and time.
