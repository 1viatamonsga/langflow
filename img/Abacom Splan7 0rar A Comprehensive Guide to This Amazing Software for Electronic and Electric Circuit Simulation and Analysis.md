To start a new project, you can either click on File > New or press Ctrl+N on your keyboard. You will be asked to choose a template for your project. A template is a predefined layout and format for your circuit diagram. You can choose from various templates that suit different types of circuits, such as analog, digital, power supply, etc. You can also create your own template or modify an existing one.
 
After you choose a template, you will see a blank drawing area with a grid. The grid helps you align and position your components on the diagram. You can change the grid size and visibility from View > Grid Settings. You can also zoom in and out of the drawing area using the mouse wheel or the buttons on the toolbar.
 
To add a component to your circuit diagram, you can either drag and drop it from the library panel or double-click on it. You can also use the search box on the library panel to find a specific component by name or keyword. When you add a component to your diagram, it will automatically snap to the grid. You can move it around by dragging it with the mouse or using the arrow keys on your keyboard. You can also rotate it by right-clicking on it and choosing Rotate.
 
To connect two components with a wire, you can either click on one of them and drag to the other one or use the Wire tool on the toolbar. You can also change the color and style of the wire from Edit > Wire Properties. To delete a wire or a component, you can either select it and press Delete on your keyboard or use the Eraser tool on the toolbar.
 
To edit a component's properties, such as its name, value, symbol, etc., you can either double-click on it or right-click on it and choose Properties. A dialog box will appear where you can modify various parameters of the component. You can also change some of these parameters directly on the diagram by clicking on them and typing in new values.
